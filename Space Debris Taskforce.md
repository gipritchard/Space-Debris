# Mission Brief

Team, our mission is critical and the stakes are high. As you know, space debris has already caused significant damage to vital satellites; threatening communication, navigation, and systems essential for life on Earth. We have repair teams in orbit as we speak to fix these malfunctioning satellites, but they don't have enough supplies to get the job done.

That's where you come in. These debris fields are full of the necessary resources we need to fix our satellites. Capture the debris, recycle it into usable resources, and deliver them to our satellite repair teams. 

Debris fields are treacherous, and additional damage will jeopardize future missions. Proceed with caution, our success is essential to the future of space exploration.

# Objective 

Flip all satellites to their operational side by delivering resources to malfunction satellites.

# Order of Play

The player who last looked at the night sky goes first, and play continues to the left. On every turn do the following three things in order:
1. Take up to 4 actions
2. Draw Debris cards
3. Orbit around Earth

## 1. Take up to 4 actions
On your turn you may take up to 4 actions, in any order. You may take the same action multiple times. You may collaborate with your teammates to decide which actions you want to take.   

### Move
![](../attachments/action_move_example.jpg)
- Move your player pawn 2 spaces following dotted lines. You may share a space with other Space Ships, Satellites, or Debris.
  - If the space you move into contains any Debris, your Space Ship takes 1 point of damage.

### Capture Debris
![](../attachments/action_capture_example.jpg)
- Move 1 Debris from an adjacent space onto your Space Ship card

OR

- Move any number of Debris from your space onto your Space Ship card
	- Space Ships can carry Debris up to their capacity. A Space Ship's capacity starts at 5, and may be upgraded via other actions.

### Recycle
![](../attachments/action_recycle_example.jpg)
- Move any number of Debris from your Space Ship card back to the supply. Draw that number of Resource cards.

See the "Hand Limit" section for restrictions. 

### Deliver
![](../attachments/action_maintenance_example.jpg)
At any malfunctioning Satellite space, you may...
- Place any number of Resource cards from your hand next to the associated Satellite card that match the required resources
- If all required resources have been delivered to a Satellite...
	- Move all Resource cards on the Satellite to the Resource discard pile
	- Flip the Satellite card from the malfunctioning side to the operational side
	- Set the Satellite's HP tracker to the maximum value
	- Your team now has access to the Satellite's team bonus
- If all Satellite cards are on the repaired side, you win!

### Repair
![](../attachments/action_repair_example.jpg)
At any Satellite space, you may...
- Increase any Space Ship's health by 1 HP, up to the maximum value

OR

- Increase a Satellite's health by 1 HP, up to the maximum value 

### Exchange Resource
![](../attachments/action_exchange_example.jpg)
While sharing a space with another player, you may...
- Give 1 Resource card to the other player

OR

- Take 1 Resource card from another player

See the "Hand Limit" section for restrictions.

### Play Resource Card
You may play a Resource card for it's effect. Place the Resource card in the Resource discard pile after resolving it's effect.
#### Fuel
- When played: move your pawn 3 spaces, ignore damage from Debris.
#### Electronics
- When played: capture any number of Debris from 1 adjacent space.
#### Plastic
- When played: upgrade your Space Ship's Debris Capacity by 1, up to a maximum of 10.
#### Metal
- When played: fully repair 1 Space Ship or 1 Satellite in your space.
#### Junk
- This is a wild resource (fuel, electronics, plastic, metal) used during a Deliver action.
- Cannot be played as an action.

## 2. Draw Debris Cards
Each space is limited to 3 Debris. As Debris accumulates in a space, the risk of a collision and fragmentation rises.

Look at the Collision tracker on the game board. This indicates the number of cards to draw from the Debris deck, and the quantity of Debris to place at a location.
![](../attachments/debris_example.jpg)
- Draw the indicated number of Debris cards 1 at a time from the Debris deck.
- If it is an orbit card...
	- Locate the associated space on the game board
	- All Space Ships and/or Satellites in that space take 1 damage
	- Add Debris from the supply to that space up to a maximum of 3 Debris
	- If the space contains 3 Debris and you must place additional Debris in that space, then a <i>collision</i> has occurred. See the Collisions section below.
	- Discard the orbit card
- If it is a fragmentation card...
	- Shuffle the Debris discard pile
		- If it is empty, draw from the top of the Debris deck until you have an orbit card
	- Locate the associated space on the game board
	- If this space contains any Space Ships or Satellites...
		- Each Space Ship & Satellite in that space takes 1 point of damage.
	- Then check to see how much Debris is in that space
	- If this space contains zero Debris
		- Place 3 Debris on that space
		- Discard the fragmentation card
		- Shuffle the Debris discard pile and Debris deck together
		- Place the Debris deck face down
	- If this space contains any Debris...
		- Increase the Collision Marker by 1 space
		- Remove all Debris from that space
		- Place 1 Debris on each adjacent space
		- Any Space Ships and/or Satellites in the adjacent spaces take 1 damage
	- Discard the fragmentation card
	- Shuffle the Debris discard pile and Debris deck together.
	- Place the Debris deck face down
- If you are required to place Debris on a space and don't have enough in the supply, your team is defeated. 

### Collisions
![](../attachments/collision_example1.jpg)
![](../attachments/collision_example2.jpg)
- Increase the Collision Marker by 1 space
	- If you are unable to increase the Collision Marker by one space, you are defeated.
- Place Debris in adjacent spaces with the fewest game pieces (Debris, Space Ships, Satellites)
	- If at any point, every adjacent space has 3 Debris and you have more Debris to place, you are defeated.

## 3. Orbit Around Earth
The final step of a player's turn is rotating the High Earth Orbit and Low Earth Orbit boards.
![](../attachments/orbit_example.jpg)
- Rotate the High Earth Orbit (HEO) board with all pieces on it, 90° clockwise
- Rotate the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) board with all pieces on it, an additional 90° clockwise

This is the end of the currnet player's turn. Play passes to the player on the left.

## Satellites
Satellites can be in two states; malfunctioning and opperational. Malfunctioning satellites do not provide any team bonuses. They need all required resources to become opperational. Once all required resources have been delievered, flip the satellite card to its opperational side.

Opperational satellites offer powerful teamwide bonuses, one time benefits, or unlock additional actions. Prioritize which satellite should be fixed first to maximize your team's chance for success.

## Hand Limit
Players have a hand limit of 5 Resource cards. If you ever have 6 or more cards in hand, you must immediately choose & discard the excess Resource cards to the Resource discard pile.

## When The Resource Deck Runs Out
Immediately shuffle the Resource discard pile and stack the cards face down to form a new Resource deck. If this happens in the middle of a turn, continue to draw Resource cards as necessary from the new pile.

# Game End

## Victory
Players are victorious if any of the following conditions are met:
- All Satellite cards are flipped to their operational side

## Defeat
Players are defeated if any of the following conditions are met:
- Any player Space Ship reaches 0 HP
- Any Satellite reaches 0 HP
- The Debris supply is empty AND players must place more debris in orbit
- Any player must place Debris on an adjacent space AND all adjacent spaces contain 3 Debris

# Optional Advanced Rules
Players looking for a more challenging experience may choose to play with any (or all) of the following rules/restrictions. This is not recommended for your first few games.

## Satellites in Peril
During initial game set up, do not flip any malfunctioning satellites to their operational side 

## Identified Debris
During initial game set up, remove all Junk cards from the Debris deck

## Excess Resources become Debris
For each Resource card discarded from a player's hand because of hand limit restrictions, add Debris to adjacent space(s) with the fewest game pieces. 
- All Space Ships and Satellites in spaces that receive Debris take 1 damage
- If there is a tie for fewest game pieces, the discarding player chooses.
- If the player must place Debris on an adjacent space AND all adjacent spaces contain 3 Debris, your team is defeated.

**Example**: Caitlin has 3 cards in hand, and chooses to recycle 4 Debris on her Space Ship. She draws 4 Resource cards and now has 7 total cards in hand. Caitlin must now choose any 2 cards in hand to discard. After discarding 2 cards, she takes 2 Debris from the supply and places them amongst adjacent spaces with the fewest game pieces.

# Glossary
**Adjacent** - Spaces are considered adjacent if they are connected by a dotted line.

**Empty** - A space with 0 game pieces.

**Game Piece** - Debris, Satellites, Space Ships.

**Passive** - An ongoing effect that costs 0 resources to use.

**Resource** - Electronics, Fuel, Plastic, Metal, Junk.
