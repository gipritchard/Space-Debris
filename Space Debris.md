# Mission Brief

Team, our mission is critical and the stakes are high. As you know, space debris has already caused significant damage to vital satellites; threatening communication, navigation, and systems essential for life on Earth. We have repair teams in orbit as we speak to fix these malfunctioning satellites, but they don't have enough supplies to get the job done.

That's where you come in. These debris fields are full of the necessary resources we need to fix our satellites. Capture the debris, recycle it into usable resources, and deliver them to our satellites. 

Debris fields are treacherous, and additional damage will jeopardize future missions. Proceed with caution, our success is essential to the future of space exploration.

# Objective 

Flip all malfunctioning satellites to their operational side by delivering the necessary resources. 
# Order of Play
The player who last looked at the night sky goes first, and play continues to the left. On every turn, do the following four things in order:
1. Take up to 4 actions
2. Assess Threat
3. Place Debris
4. Orbit around Earth

## 1. Take up to 4 actions
On your turn you may take up to 4 actions, in any order. You may take the same action multiple times. You may collaborate with your teammates to decide which actions you want to take.   

### Thrust
- Move your pawn up to 2 spaces following dotted lines. 
	- You may share a space with other pawns, satellites, or debris.
	- If the space you move into contains any debris, your spaceship takes 1 point of damage.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gipritchard/Space-Debris/refs/heads/main/assets/screenshots/TX_Rulebook_Action_MoveExample.png" width=200/>
*Example: Caitlin chooses the thrust action and moves her pawn twice. Her first move places her to 'Satellite B's space. Her second move places her in a space with two debris. Even though the space has more than 1 debris, she only takes 1 point of damage.*
### Capture Debris
- Move any number of debris from your space onto your spaceship.

OR

- Move 1 debris from an adjacent space onto your spaceship.

Spaceships carry debris up to their capacity. A spaceship's capacity starts at 5, and may be upgraded via other actions.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gipritchard/Space-Debris/refs/heads/main/assets/screenshots/TX_Rulebook_Action_CaptureExample.png" width=200/>
*Example: Caitlin decides to capture twice. Her first capture action moves both debris from her space onto her Spaceship card. Her second capture action moves 1 debris from an adjacent space onto her Spaceship card. She now has 3 debris on her spaceship, and has room for 2 more debris.*

### Recycle
- Move any number of debris from your spaceship back to the supply, then draw that number of resource cards.
	- If you recycle 5 or more debris in one action, decrease Threat by 1 space

See the "Hand Limit" section for restrictions. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gipritchard/Space-Debris/refs/heads/main/assets/screenshots/TX_Rulebook_Action_RecycleExample.png"  />
*Example: Caitlin chooses to recycle all 3 debris on her spaceship card. She moves the debris to the supply, and draws 3 resource cards. She has less than 5 cards in hand, and does not need to discard excess resource cards.*
### Deliver
At any malfunctioning Satellite space, you may...
- Place any number of Resource cards from your hand next to the associated Satellite card that match the required resources
- If all required resources have been delivered to a Satellite...
	- Decrease Threat by 1 space
	- Move all Resource cards from the Satellite to the Resource discard pile
	- Flip the Satellite card from the malfunctioning side to the operational side
	- Set the Satellite's HP tracker to the maximum value
	- Your team now has access to the Satellite's team bonus
- If all Satellite cards are on the operational side, you win!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gipritchard/Space-Debris/refs/heads/main/assets/screenshots/TX_Rulebook_Action_DeliverExample.png"  />
*Example: Satellite B needs 2 more fuel and 1 more electronics to be operational. Caitlin has 1 fuel, and 2 junk (wild) resource cards in hand. She moves to Satellite B, then uses the deliver action. Satellite B now has all required resources! She flips the card to operational, fully heals the satellite, decreases threat by 1, then discards all resource cards next to the satellite. All players now has access to the Onboard Boosters satellite action.*
### Repair
At any Satellite space, you may...
- Increase your spaceship's health by 1.

OR

- Increase the satellite's health by 1.

OR

- Increase a teammate spaceship's health by 1, if they are also in your space.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gipritchard/Space-Debris/refs/heads/main/assets/screenshots/TX_Rulebook_Action_RepairExample.png"  />
*Example: Austin (orange) is on Satellite C's space with Caitlin (blue), and chooses the repair action. He can choose to heal 1 point of damage on himself, Caitlin, or Satellite C. Austin is at 1 HP and chooses himself, increasing his health from 1 to 2.*
### Exchange Resource
While sharing a space with another player, you may...
- Give 1 Resource card to the other player

OR

- Take 1 Resource card from the other player

See the "Hand Limit" section for restrictions.

### Play Resource Card
#### Fuel
- Discard this card to move your pawn up to 3 spaces, ignoring debris damage.
#### Electronics
- Discard this card to capture any number of debris from 1 adjacent space.
#### Plastic
- Discard this card to upgrade your spaceship's debris capacity by 1.
#### Metal
- Discard this card to fully repair 1 spaceship or satellite in your space.
#### Junk
- This is a wild resource (fuel, electronics, plastic, metal) used during a Deliver action.
- Cannot be played as an action.

### Activate Satellite
Some operational satellites grant your team access to unique actions. During your turn you may spend an action to perform the action printed on an operational satellite card.  

## 2. Assess Threat
The threat track determines how many orbit cards to draw, and the quantity of debris that will be placed into orbit. Threat gradually increases over time, but your team can mitigate it through thoughtful strategy and coordination. 

↑ Threat increases when...
- Any player flips a _fragmentation_ card
- Debris causes a _collision_
- Any satellite receives _damage_

↓ Threat decreases when...
- Any player recycles 5 or more debris in a single action
- Any satellite becomes operational

| Threat Level | # of orbit cards to draw | 1st card debris | 2nd card debris | 3rd card debris |
| :----------: | :----------------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
|      1       |            2             |        1        |        1        |        -        |
|      2       |            2             |        1        |        2        |        -        |
|      3       |            3             |        1        |        1        |        2        |
|      4       |            3             |        1        |        2        |        2        

![[TX_Rulebook_Threat.png]]
*Example: John is ready to draw orbit cards. He looks at the threat level. His team's threat level is 2. John draws 2 orbit cards, without looking at them, and places them face down near the game board. John places 1 debris cube on top of the 1st orbit card. Finally, he places 2 debris cubes on top of the 2nd orbit card.*

### Assessing Threat
- Look at the threat track to determine your threat level
- Draw orbit cards from the orbit deck, and place them face down near the game board
- Place debris from the supply on top of the face down orbit cards
	- The debris on top of these cards will be used in the upcoming Place Debris step
	- If the supply does not have enough debris to complete this step, your team is defeated.
## 3. Place Debris
Each space is limited to 3 debris. As debris accumulates, the risk of a _collision_ increases and _fragmentation_ becomes more dangerous. If you are required to place debris on a space and don't have enough in the supply, your team is defeated. 

- Flip face down orbit cards 1 at a time
- Resolve each card
	- If threat level increases, do **not** draw additional cards or change debris amount
- Repeat until all cards are discarded
### Orbit Card
- Locate the space on the game board
- Deal 1 damage to each spaceship in this space
- If this space has a satellite...
	- Deal 1 damage to the satellite
	- Increase Threat by 1 space
- Add debris to this space
	- If this space contains more than 3 debris, then a _collision_ has occurred. See the Collision section below.
- Discard this card

![[TX_Rulebook_PlaceDebris_Example1.png]]
*Example 1: Michael has a facedown orbit card in front of him with 1 debris on it. He flips it face up, and finds that space on the game board. The space is empty. Michael places the 1 debris from the card onto that space. Finally, he discards the orbit card.*

![[TX_Rulebook_PlaceDebris_Example2.png]]
*Example 2: Michael has a facedown orbit card in front of him with 2 debris on it. He flips it face up, and finds that space on the game board. The space contains the 'D' satellite token. He deals 1 damage to the 'D' satellite, increases Threat by 1, then places 2 debris onto that space. Finally, he discards the orbit card.*
### Fragmentation Card
- Increase Threat by 1 space
- Draw the top card of the orbit deck
	- If you draw another fragmentation card, discard it. Draw until you receive an orbit card.
- Place 3 debris in that space, resolving the orbit card as indicated above
- Shuffle the orbit discard and draw piles together
- Discard this card

![[TX_Rulebook_Fragmentation.png]]
*Example: John has a facedown orbit card in front of him with 1 debris on it. He flips it face up to reveal a Fragmentation card. He increases threat by 1 space, then draws the top card of the orbit deck. He finds that space on the gameboard. It contains 2 debris and his pawn, unlucky! He deals 1 damage to himself, and places 3 debris into his space (1 from his orbit card, and 2 from the supply).*
*His space now contains 5 debris. This causes a collision. Because of the collision, he increases threat by 1 space, and moves 2 debris to an adjacent space with the fewest game pieces. In this case the space to the right. John discards the orbit card, the shuffles the orbit discard and draw piles together. John has fully resolved the fragmentation card and collision. He discards the fragmentation card starting a new discard pile.*

### Collision
Collisions occur when a space contains more than 3 debris. This knocks excess debris into an adjacent space with the fewest game pieces (Debris, Spaceships, Satellites). Its possible for a collision to cause a chain reaction if debris accumulation goes unchecked. When a collision occurs, perform the following steps in order:

- Increase Threat by 1 space
- Place excess debris in an adjacent space with the fewest game pieces 
	- If there is a tie for fewest game pieces, the current player chooses.
	- If every adjacent space has 3 debris, you are defeated.

![[TX_Rulebook_Collision.png]]
*Example: Alex must add 2 debris to a space that contains 3 debris. This causes a collision. Alex increases Threat by 1. Next, he looks at all adjacent spaces. The left space contains 1 pawn, the right space contains 1 debris, and the space below contains a satellite and 1 pawn. The left space and right space are tied for fewest game pieces, Alex can choose between them. Alex chooses the right space, and places 2 debris into that space.*

## 4. Orbit Around Earth
The final step of a player's turn is rotating the High Earth Orbit and Low Earth Orbit boards.

![[TX_Rulebook_Orbit.png]]
- Rotate the High Earth Orbit (HEO) board with all pieces on it, 90° clockwise
- Rotate the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) board with all pieces on it, an additional 90° clockwise

This is the end of the current player's turn. Play passes to the player on the left.

## Hand Limit
Players have a hand limit of 5 Resource cards. If you ever have 6 or more cards in hand, you must immediately choose & discard the excess Resource cards to the Resource discard pile.

## When The Resource Deck Runs Out
Immediately shuffle the Resource discard pile and stack the cards face down to form a new Resource deck. If this happens in the middle of a turn, continue to draw Resource cards as necessary from the new pile.

## Satellites
Satellites can be in two states; malfunctioning and operational. Malfunctioning satellites do not provide any team bonuses. They need all required resources to become operational. Once all required resources have been delivered, flip the satellite card to its operational side and full heal the satellite.

Operational satellites offer powerful teamwide bonuses, one time benefits, or unlock additional actions. Prioritize which satellite should be fixed first to maximize your team's chance for success.

# Game End

## Victory
Players are victorious if all Satellite cards are flipped to their operational side

## Defeat
Players are defeated if any of the following conditions are met:
- Any player spaceship reaches 0 HP
- Any satellite reaches 0 HP
- The debris supply is empty AND players must place more debris in orbit
- A collision occurs AND all adjacent spaces contain 3 debris

# Optional Advanced Rules
Players looking for a more challenging experience may choose to play with any (or all) of the following rules/restrictions. This is not recommended for your first few games.

## Satellites in Peril
During initial game set up, do not flip any malfunctioning satellites to their operational side 

## Identified Debris
During initial game set up, remove all Junk cards from the Resource deck

## Excess Resources become Debris
For each Resource card discarded from a player's hand because of hand limit restrictions, add debris to an adjacent space with the fewest game pieces. 
- If there is a tie for fewest game pieces, the discarding player chooses.
- If all adjacent spaces contain 3 debris, your team is defeated.

**Example**: Caitlin has 3 cards in hand, and chooses to recycle 4 debris on her Spaceship. She draws 4 Resource cards and now has 7 total cards in hand. Caitlin must now choose any 2 cards in hand to discard. After discarding 2 cards, she takes 2 debris from the supply and places them in an adjacent space with the fewest game pieces.

# Glossary
**Adjacent** - Spaces are considered adjacent if they are connected by a dotted line.

**Empty** - A space with 0 game pieces.

**Game Piece** - Debris, Pawns, Satellites.

**Passive** - An ongoing effect that costs 0 resources to use.

**Resource** - Electronics, Fuel, Plastic, Metal, Junk.

# FAQs

**Q**: How much damage do I take if my thrust action moves me into 2 spaces that both contain debris?
**A**: Each time your pawn moves into a space with debris, you take 1 damage. In this situation, you take 2 damage total.
