# Objective

Team, your mission is critical, and the stakes are high. As you know, space debris has already caused significant damage to vital satellites, threatening communication, navigation, and weather systems critical for life on Earth. Your goal is twofold: clear these debris fields and repair damaged satellites. 

You will be armed with cutting-edge technology and specialized tools. You will remove defunct satellites, rocket fragments, and other hazardous objects while also performing vital repairs on operational assets. The debris field is treacherous, and further damage to satellites will jeopardize future missions. Proceed with caution, your success is essential to the future of space exploration.

# Order of Play

The player who last looked at the night sky goes first, and play continues to the left. On every turn do the following three things in order.
1. Take up to 4 actions
2. Draw Debris cards
3. Orbit around Earth
## 1. Take up to 4 actions
On your turn you may take up to 4 actions, in any order. You may take the same action multiple times. You may collaborate with your teammates to decide which actions you want to take.   
### Move
![](../attachments/action_move_example.jpg)
- Move your player pawn 1 space following dotted lines.  
If the space you move into contains any Debris Cubes, your Space Ship takes 1 point of damage. Players may share a space with other players and/or a satellite.
### Capture Debris
![](../attachments/action_capture_example.jpg)
- Move 1 Debris Cube from an adjacent space onto your Space Ship card
OR
- Move any number of Debris Cubes from your space onto your Space Ship card
Space Ships are limited to carrying a maximum of 5 Debris Cubes at any time.
### Recycle
![](../attachments/action_recycle_example.jpg)
At any repaired Satellite space...
- Move any number of Debris Cubes from your Space Ship card back to the supply. Draw that number of Resource cards.
See the "Hand Limit" section for restrictions. 
### Perform Maintenance
![](../attachments/action_maintenance_example.jpg)
At any broken Satellite space, you may...
- Place any number of Resource cards from your hand onto the associated Satellite card matching the required resources
- If all required resources have been delivered to a Satellite...
	- Move all Resource cards on the Satellite to the Resource discard pile
	- Flip the associated Satellite card from the broken side to the repaired side
	- Set that Satellite's HP tracker to the maximum value  
- If all Satellite cards are on the repaired side, you win!
### Repair
![](../attachments/action_repair_example.jpg)
At any Satellite space, you may...
- Increase your Space Ship's health by 1 HP, up to the maximum
OR
- Increase the associated Satellite's health by 1 HP, up to the maximum
### Exchange Resource
![](../attachments/action_exchange_example.jpg)
While sharing a space with another player, you may...
- Give 1 Resource card to the other player
OR
- Take 1 Resource card from the other player
See the "Hand Limit" section for restrictions.
### Play Resource Card
You may play a Resource card for it's effect. Place the Resource card in the Resource discard pile after resolving it's effect.
#### Fuel
- Move your player pawn twice following the dotted lines. 
#### Electronics
- Capture any number of Debris Cubes from 1 adjacent space. 
- Place the Debris Cubes on your Space Ship card.
#### Plastic
- Recycle any number of Debris Cubes on your Space Ship card. 
- Draw that number of Resource cards.
See the "Hand Limit" section for restrictions.
#### Metal
- Fully repair 1 Space Ship or 1 Satellite in your space.
- Move the target's HP tracker to the maximum value
#### Junk
Cannot be played as an action. This card is a wild resource (fuel, electronics, plastic, metal) used during a Repair action.

## 2. Draw Debris Cards
Each space on the game board is limited to 3 Debris Cubes. As Debris accumulates in a space, the risk of a collision and fragmentation rises.   

Look at the Collision tracker on the game board. This indicates the number of cards to draw from the Debris deck, and the number of Debris cubes to place at that location.
![](../attachments/debris_example.jpg)
- Draw the indicated number of Debris cards 1 at a time from the Debris deck.
- If it is an orbit card...
	- Locate the associated space on the game board
	- All Space Ships and/or Satellites in that space take 1 damage
	- Add Debris Cubes from the supply to that space 1 at a time
	- If the space contains 3 Debris Cubes and you must place additional Debris Cubes in that space a <i>collision</i> has occurred. See the collision section below.
	- Discard the orbit card
- If it is a fragmentation card...
	- Shuffle the Debris discard pile
		- If it is empty, draw from the top of the Debris deck until you have an orbit card
	- Locate the associated space on the game board
	- If this space contains any Debris Cubes...
		- Remove all Debris Cubes from that space
		- Place 1 Debris Cube on each adjacent space
		- Any Space Ships and/or Satellites in the adjacent spaces take 1 damage
	- Discard the fragmentation card
	- Shuffle the Debris discard pile and Debris deck together.
	- Place the Debris deck face down
- If you are required to place Debris Cubes on a space and don't have enough in the supply, your team is defeated. 
### Collisions
![](../attachments/collision_example.jpg)
- Increase the Collision Marker by 1 space
	- If you are unable to increase the Collision Marker by one space, you are defeated.
- TODO

## 3. Orbit Around Earth
The final step of a player's turn is rotating the High Earth Orbit and Low Earth Orbit boards. Only perform this step if neither of these game boards rotated during the current player's turn.
![](../attachments/orbit_example.jpg)
- Rotate the High Earth Orbit (HEO) board with all pieces on it, 90° clockwise
- Rotate the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) board with all pieces on it, 180° clockwise
Play passes to the player on the left.
## Hand Limit
Players have a hand limit of 5 Resource cards. If you ever have 6 or more cards in hand, you must immediately choose & discard the excess Resource cards to the Resource discard pile. 
- For each Resource card discarded this way, add 1 Debris Cube to an adjacent space with the fewest game pieces (Space Ships, Satellite, Debris Cubes). All Space Ships and Satellites in that space take 1 damage when the Debris Cube is added to their space.
	- If there is a tie for fewest game pieces, the discarding player chooses.
	- If the player is surrounded on all sides by spaces that contain 3 Debris Cubes, your team is defeated.
## When The Resource Deck Runs Out
Immediately shuffle the Resource discard pile and stack the cards face down to form a new Resource deck. If this happens in the middle of a turn, continue to draw Resource cards as necessary from the new pile.

# Game End
## Victory
Players are victorious if any of the following conditions are met:
- All Satellite cards are flipped to their repaired side
## Defeat
Players are defeated if any of the following conditions are met:
- Any player's Space Ship reaches 0 HP
- Any Satellite reaches 0 HP
- You run out of Debris Cubes to place on the map
- Any player must place a Debris Cube on an adjacent space AND all adjacent spaces contain 3 Debris Cubes.
