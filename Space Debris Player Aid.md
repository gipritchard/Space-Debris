# Order of Play
1. Take up to 4 actions
2. Assess Threat
3. Place Debris
4. Orbit around Earth

## 1. Take up to 4 actions

### Thrust
- Move your pawn up to 2 spaces. 

### Capture Debris
- Move any number of debris from your space onto your spaceship.

OR

- Move 1 debris from an adjacent space onto your spaceship.

### Recycle
- Move debris from your spaceship back to the supply, then draw that number of resource cards.
	- If you recycle 5 or more debris in one action, decrease Threat by 1 space

### Repair
At any malfunctioning Satellite space, you may...
- Place any number of Resource cards from your hand next to the associated Satellite card that match the required resources
- If the Satellite has all required resources...
	- Decrease Threat by 1 space
	- Move all Resource cards from the Satellite to the Resource discard pile
	- Flip the Satellite card from the malfunctioning side to the operational side
	- Set the Satellite's HP tracker to the maximum value
	- Gain access to the Satellite's team bonus

### Heal
At any Satellite space, you may...
- Increase your spaceship's health by 1.

OR

- Increase the satellite's health by 1.

OR

- Increase a teammate spaceship's health by 1, if they are also in your space.

### Exchange Resource
While sharing a space with another player, you may...
- Give 1 Resource card to the other player

OR

- Take 1 Resource card from the other player

### Play Resource Card
Discard a resource card from your hand to activate it's effect
### Activate Operational Satellite
Perform the action printed on an operational satellite card 

## 2. Assess Threat
- Look at the threat track to determine your threat level
- Draw orbit cards from the orbit deck, and place them face down near the game board
- Place debris from the supply on top of the face down orbit cards

↑ Threat increases when...
- Any player flips a _fragmentation_ card
- Debris causes a _collision_
- Any satellite receives _damage_

↓ Threat decreases when...
- Any player recycles 5 or more debris in a single action
- Any satellite becomes operational

## 3. Place Debris
- Flip face down orbit cards 1 at a time
- Resolve each card
	- If threat level increases, do **not** draw additional cards or change debris amount
- Repeat until all cards are discarded
### Orbit Card
- Locate the space on the game board
- Deal 1 damage to each spaceship in this space
- If this space has a satellite...
	- Deal 1 damage to the satellite
	- Increase Threat by 1 space
- Add debris to this space
	- If this space contains more than 3 debris, then a _collision_ has occurred. See the Collision section below.
- Discard this card
### Fragmentation Card
- Increase Threat by 1 space
- Draw the top card of the orbit deck
	- If you draw another fragmentation card, discard it. Draw until you receive an orbit card.
- Place 3 debris in that space, resolving the orbit card as indicated above
- Shuffle the orbit discard and draw piles together
- Discard this card
### Collision
- Increase Threat by 1 space
- Place excess debris in an adjacent space with the fewest game pieces 

## 4. Orbit Around Earth
- Rotate the High Earth Orbit (HEO) board with all pieces on it, 90° clockwise
- Rotate the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) board with all pieces on it, an additional 90° clockwise
