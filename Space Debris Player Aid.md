OR

- Move 1 debris from an adjacent space onto your spaceship card.

- If all required resources have been delivered to a Satellite...
	- Decrease Threat by 1 space

### Activate Operational Satellite
Perform the action printed on an operational satellite card 

## 2. Assess Threat
- Look at the threat track to determine your threat level
- Draw orbit cards from the orbit deck, and place them face down near the game board
- Place debris from the supply on top of the face down orbit cards

↑ Threat increases when...
- Any player flips a _fragmentation_ card
- Debris causes a _collision_
- Any satellite receives _damage_

↓ Threat decreases when...
- Any player recycles 5 or more debris in a single action
- Any satellite becomes operational

## 3. Place Debris
- Flip face down orbit cards 1 at a time
- Resolve each card
	- If threat level increases, do **not** draw additional cards or change debris amount
- Repeat until all cards are discarded
### Orbit Card
- Locate the space on the game board
- All spaceships in this space take 1 damage
- Any satellite in this space takes 1 damage AND Threat increases by 1 space
- Add debris to this space
	- If the space contains more than 3 debris, then a <i>collision</i> has occurred. See the Collision section below.
- Discard this card
### Fragmentation Card
- Increase Threat by 1 space
- Draw the top card of the orbit deck
	- If you draw another fragmentation card, discard it. Draw until you receive an orbit card.
- Place 3 debris in that space, resolving the orbit card as indicated above
- Shuffle the orbit discard and draw piles together
- Discard this card
### Collision
- Increase Threat by 1 space
- Place excess debris in an adjacent space with the fewest game pieces 

## 4. Orbit Around Earth
- Rotate the High Earth Orbit (HEO) board with all pieces on it, 90° clockwise
- Rotate the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) board with all pieces on it, an additional 90° clockwise
